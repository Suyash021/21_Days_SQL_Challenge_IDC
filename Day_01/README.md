# Day 1 of the IDC 21 Days of SQL Challenge sponsored by DPDzero started with the basics.

Simple concepts, yet so powerful when you actually use them.
Here's what I learned today:
How to view and filter data using SELECT
How to choose specific columns
How to check data structure
How to find unique values with DISTINCT
Day 1 Challenge:
List all unique hospital services.
SELECT DISTINCT service_name FROM services_weekly;
My takeaway:
It's not just about writing queries.
It's about asking the right questions from your data.
If you're learning SQL too, join the challenge, let's grow and learn together.
Indian Data Club, DPDzero, thank you for starting and supporting this initiative.
